My plan is to use RFdiffusion to design new proteins. I think I would like to try designing proteins to do direct air capture of CO2. So far I have been able to run an example notebook in Google Colab and generate some different proteins. So far these proteins are 'free' or 'unconditional.' I am kind of stuck on how to give the model other constraints (besides number of amino acids)

It seems there is a bug in the example notebook preventing any sort of initial structure to be given. I'm not familiar with the way the code was written and running things on colab, so it took me some time to get around it, but I figured how to run the script more directly (rather than through the wrapper they provide in the example notebook
